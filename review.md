Erik, it's not hard to give you a 3 on this assignment. It looks great, I checked out your code on PEP8 online check and 
it didn't have any major issues. I really like that you added a test file to help show that your package worked. I also really 
liked your functions they were very clean and crisp. I have to literally grasp at straws to find anything that could be considered 
constructive. In the PEP8 online check line 34 didn't have a new line at the end of the document. I honestly think that doesn't matter 
because it looks great man. Keep up the good work!
